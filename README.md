# Model explorer

Model explorer is a 3D model viewer built with Godot 4. It supports various model formats like VRM and glTF 2.0. With this tool, you can dive deep into the components of a 3D model - inspecting meshes, materials, textures, and animations. It comes packed with features such as detailed viewing, animation playback, interactive controls, and a double-click action for an up-close examination. You also have the option to hide the grid or explode the meshes. So, it's a pretty handy tool if you're looking to explore 3D models in detail.
